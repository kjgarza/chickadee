  <p>
    Kitchen Timer is a tiny cooking companion that keeps me calm at the stove. I wanted a way to keep step timings honest while still enjoying the cooking moment—the same spirit Simon Willison captured when he wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/23/cooking-with-claude/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking with Claude</a>. Instead of juggling mental timers or scrolling through recipe pages, I wanted a focused flow that stays with me from prep to plating.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reduce mental overhead while cooking:</strong> timers, durations, and next steps stay visible without bouncing around tabs.</li>
    <li><strong>Give friends and family confidence</strong> to cook together, even if I'm not in the room.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment faster</strong> by keeping steps structured so I can compare results and iterate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Readable at a glance.</strong> Industrial monospace typography and high contrast make states and numbers clear from across the kitchen.</li>
    <li><strong>Action-first UI.</strong> The current timer, next step, and ingredients are all in one vertical rhythm for mobile cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Honest timing.</strong> All timings come from structured recipe data so the countdowns stay repeatable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>
  <p>
    I'm exploring parallel step guidance, richer finish criteria, and more recipes tuned for this format. If you have ideas, reach out via the links in the footer.
