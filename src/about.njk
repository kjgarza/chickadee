    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight">Why I built Chickadee</h1>
    <p>
      Chickadee is a tiny cooking companion that keeps me calm at the stove. I wanted a way to keep step timings honest while still enjoying the cooking moment&mdash;the same spirit Simon Willison captured when he wrote about <a class="link link-primary" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/23/cooking-with-claude/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking with Claude</a>. Instead of juggling mental timers or scrolling through recipe pages, I wanted a focused flow that stays with me from prep to plating.

    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce mental overhead while cooking: timers, durations, and next steps stay visible without bouncing around tabs.</li>
      <li>Give friends and family confidence to cook together, even if I'm not in the room.</li>
      <li>Experiment faster by keeping steps structured so I can compare results and iterate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Readable at a glance.</strong> Minimal rounded corners, a serif headline, and a mono body font make states and numbers clear.</li>
      <li><strong>Action-first UI.</strong> The current timer, next step, and ingredients are all in one vertical rhythm for mobile cooking.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest timing.</strong> All timings come from structured recipe data so the countdowns stay repeatable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's next</h2>
    <p>
      I'm exploring parallel step guidance, richer finish criteria, and more recipes tuned for this format. If you have ideas, reach out via the links in the footer.
